==========

This computer exercise explored the two ways to code using VDHL: behavioral and structural. We created a 2-4 bit decoder using behavioral and structural programming to show the differences in each.

show that both of these screen shots show the same functionality, however, the structural testbench was eaiser to write because it incorporated all of the functions of the circuit into a few lines of code instead of writing out a truth table for the entire testbench.

#How does a decoder work

How does a decoder work and how can that funcitonality be useful in the context of computer memory?
